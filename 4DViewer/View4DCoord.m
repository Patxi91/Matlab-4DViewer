function [x,y,z,data] = View4DCoord(hObject, eventdata, handles)
% View4DCoord - returns the coordinates that the pointer overlaps
% object, hObject.
%
% Usage:
% ------
% [x,y,z] = View4DCoord(hObject) - x, y, and z are the coordinates of
% the point where mouse pointer overlaps with the nearest object in the
% display axis of View4D.
%
% [x,y,z,data] = View4DCoord(hObject) - Also returns the 4th dimension 
% time-activity-curve (TAC) associated with the pixel at the x,y,z 
% coordinates. The data is an 1-by-n array representing the 4th dimension 
% of the data.
%
% This function can be used as part of a callback (set with the 
% PopinterCallback property) from View4D to determine the coordinates of
% the point that the user has clicked with the mouse, as demopnstrated in 
% DisplayPixelCurve.
